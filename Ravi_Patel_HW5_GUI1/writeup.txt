Ravi Patel HW5 write up
This program is an in progress implementation of a single-line scrabble game.
I was able to achieve most of the visual implementation save for the validation
of the stacking of the tiles in the slots. I also was able to properly select the
initial tiles based on their proper weights as seen in the getRandomPiece function.
The tiles are able to be dragged and dropped onto target slots. My board also includes bonus squares,
though because there is no point scoring there is no way to calculate their value.
Tiles can also only be dragged onto a slot from the rack, and cannot be moved somewhere else off the page.
I kept the functionality of allowing pieces to be dragged between slots because it allowed the user
to change their entry if needed and figured it was not efficient to keep the slots locked.
Finally, there is always a reset button to clear the board and effectively reset the game.
Based on all of this criteria, despite the failure to fully implement the program, I believe
I was able to achieve half of the points given in this assignment (24) (including the writeup)
I appreciate any consideration you can give me, thanks for being a great TA!
